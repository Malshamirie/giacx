Note: It is important to ensure that the version of the plugin bundle you use matches the version of your website to avoid any compatibility issues.

How to submit licenses and get support?

We have introduced a new license validation system for Rocket LMS v2 or above.
To activate the products and access all features and support, you must register and validate your license through our CRM system. The new system no longer requires a license file. By simply registering your license in the CRM, activation is done immediately and automatically.


How to register your license in the CRM?

1. Log in to your CRM account and go to the "Licenses" section from the sidebar
2. Click on the "New License" button.
3. Enter your item purchase code and select the correct product.
4. Enter the exact domain where you plan to install the product.
5. Click "Validate & Save".

Your license will be activated instantly if all details are correct.


⚠️ Important: Make sure the domain you enter matches the domain where the product will be installed. If they don't match, your license won’t work on your website.
